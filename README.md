Glucose monitoring system is a closed loop feedback system used to control the glucose level of a diabetic patient.
It consists of a nonlinear Kalman filter used for estimating the states of the patient and a contoller for giving controlled insulin dosage
Implementation of controller and filter are done using Matlab and simulink wherein a simulink model is used to demonstrate how the insulin dosage changes acccording to the current glucose level of the patient
